# Overview

The BXI Base Library provides C libraries for high-level
programming. See
[High Level Programming in C](misc/articles/hlpic/resources/index.ipynb).

## Main Features

 - Fail-fast memory management
 - Rich and efficient error handling
 - Easy string manipulation
 - Zeromq wrapper to ease safe concurrent/Parallel and distributed programming

All these features can be accessed as Python modules through the same
