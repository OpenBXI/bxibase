    "# High Level Programming in C\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the TIOBE report available at http://www.tiobe.com, Java and C are the two most popular languages for 15 years. Both share more than 30% of the ratings; other languages holds 6% or less of these ratings. While C is categorized a high level language, it remains mostly seen by average developers as a low level one with a high learning curve. One reason might be its excellent mapping with hardware which makes it a good candidate for operating system design. But we believe this is not the only reason, even not the main reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we present a set of requirements for high level programming that in our opinion are not fulfilled by the C language. For each requirement exposed, a solution is proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a project from scratch (in C) requires adopting coding style, coding convention, packaging rules among others that are shortly described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other languages, the C standard does not provide any coding convention *per se*. This leads to various coding convention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style. The [C FAQ](http://c-faq.com/style/layout.html) advises to follow the K&R coding style. We are even a bit stricter and we follow this guideline: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also adopt the following convention:\n",
    "* most modules provides an object-oriented interface: for a given structure ``struct foo``, most module functions are defined by ``func(foo_p self, ...)`` where ``foo_p`` is a pointer on ``struct foo`` and represent the \"object\" on which the function ``func`` operates;\n",
    "* enumeration are suffixed by ``_e``;\n",
    "* static names defined in the .c file are prefixed with an underscore such as in ``_a_static_func(...)``;\n",
    "* internal API within a module implementation use double underscore to differenciate with external API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide two templates that ease structuring the code in a consistent manner:\n",
    "* header file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "* implementation file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Quality Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither C11, nor POSIX define code quality convention. There exist however at least two \"standards\" related somehow to this topic:\n",
    "* MISRA: initially for the automative industry but now enlargen to embedded system:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C;\n",
    "* CERT C Coding Standard: defines a set of rules and recommandation for security and safety: https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/HQE \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is the tooling required to ensure you conform to those standard. They might not be free of charge. At the very minimum, we recommand the following:\n",
    "* Compilation flags: turn all warning into error, all warnings must be treated before any release of the product; the sooner those warnings are taken into account, the easier the maintenance of the product on the long term. For example, with gcc, CFLAGS are: \n",
    "\n",
    "    CFLAGS=\"-wall ...\"  # TODO DEFINE\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Compile with various compilers ---  at the very least, gcc and clang: each compiler might raise some issues unseen by others;\n",
    "* Use [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) systematically to detect memory problems. We use the following option for valgrind:\n",
    "\n",
    "    VALGRIND_OPTS=\"...\" # TODO DEFINE \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of a project is important, especially when the project is made of several subprojects. If each subproject holds the same layout, it becomes much easier to find out a given file. Therefore, we propose the following layout that should fit most projects requirements:\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versionning\n",
    "\n",
    "Versionning a product is not so easy. First, one must adopt the versionning convention. There are many ways for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning. We propose to follow a quite common convention:\n",
    "``major.minor.fix-release`` where:\n",
    "* ``major`` is incremented when incompatible changes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``minor`` is incremented when compatible changes have been introduced (new functions in the API for example);\n",
    "* ``fix`` is incremented when only bug fixes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``release`` is incremented when only packaging have been changed such as layout, makefile, or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the versionning scheme has been designed, providing this version at the code level must be done in order to  implement the ``cmd --version`` or the ``About...`` dialog box. This can be done using the following API:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: define and implement an API for version management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages provide a system (integrated or not) to retrieve dependencies. For example, Java use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/), Python uses [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), Go has the [``go``](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) tool, ruby uses [``gem``](https://rubygems.org/) but C provides nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the guideline defined here, especially concerning [Packaging](#Packaging) and [Versionning](#Versionning), we propose a tool that might use dependency management of C packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: make ``bxivcs`` a product and describe it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the main difference between modern languages such as Java, Python, or Go, is the development cycle. Since Python is an interpreted language, it offers naturally the fastest one: code -> run. C, Java and Go must be compiled and their development cycle therefore includes one more step: code -> compile -> run. In particular, Java is so well integrated within \"modern\" IDEs such as Eclipse or Netbeans that the compile phase is mostly transparent. Therefore, at least in Java, the development cycle remains as fast as for any interpreted language: code -> run. Despite the support for the C language by Eclipse, it does not currently provide the same level of integration than with the Java language. This might change in the next future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages provide various mechanism that ease the debugging:\n",
    "* no direct access to memory;\n",
    "* smart boundary checking (that can be removed at runtime sometimes without harm);\n",
    "* stack trace on error with dynamic message, including file, function and line number;\n",
    "* assertion system that can be de-activated at runtime; \n",
    "* logging system that helps to understand what happens at runtime;\n",
    "* monitoring system (at least in Java, with JMX).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, C11 does not provide any way to produce a stack trace, nor a logging system, neither a monitoring system. POSIX does not provide anything comparable to what \"modern\" languages provide (more on that [later](#Standard Libraries)). Therefore, most of the time, in C, when a problem occurs, it can result in a segmentation fault at best (with the famous ``core dumped`` message), and undetected at worst (e.g. memory corruption).\n",
    "\n",
    "One first solution for this problem is to guarantee code quality using several tools and techniques already presented in section [Code Quality Convention](#Code Quality Convention). But this is not sufficient to accelarate the development cycle: using ``gdb`` or ``valgrind`` for simple bugs is too costly/time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "POSIX ``assert.h`` module is also not sufficient: assertion can only be disabled at compile time, not at runtime, and the error message is quite minimal: the stacktrace for example, is not included. Finally, of course, ``printf()`` is not a good option for a logging system: it is too costly, it does not provide enough information (thread, module, function, line), and cannot be partly disabled in a module and not in another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, some important libraries are missing for debugging as will be discussed in [Standard Libraries](#Standard Libraries). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard documentation of the C language is the venerable man page system. Despite being usefull for commands or configuration files, it does not compete with other documentation system specifically designed for APIs such as ``javadoc``, ``pydoc``, ``godoc`` and so on:\n",
    "* searching with the ``apropos`` command provides too many items, most of them are useless (e.g.: wrong section);\n",
    "* relation between structures/types/modules is not dynamic/hypertext;\n",
    "* no figure or schema can be provided since the system is text based;\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) since it supports C natively, and also C++, Java, Perl and Python. It has some drawbacks however, but we did not find any other good alternative suitable for projects that includes both C code *and* Python code. One major advantage we found with Doxygen however is its ability to support code snippet from examples and how it links them with the documentation. One example here: [TODO: provide the link](http://somewhere.net/bxibase/examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, despite its age --- C has been invented in the early 70's by Dennis Richie --- it is very poor in general purpose standard libraries. For example, while the current C standard --- known as C11 --- has been specified in 2011 by http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf, it still does not provide generic list or hashtable comparable to what can be found in ”modern” languages such as Java, Python, Perl, Go, Haskell, among many others. In theory, one should distinguish the language --- the set of syntaxic and grammar rules that defines it --- from the default set of libraries provided with it. But in practice, both makes a whole that must fulfill an industrial project requirements. Most modern languages provide a very rich set of default libraries. A comparison between the documentation of the C11 default standard library https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Header_files  and at least one \"modern\" language makes this statement quite clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html,\n",
    "* Python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Perl: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Go: https://golang.org/pkg/#stdlib\n",
    "* Haskell: https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellpa2.html#x20-192000II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the POSIX standard defined in http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ provides many additionnal libraries to C11 --- general purpose hashtable and list can be found in the search.h header for example --- it is far from sufficient to be comparable to what is provided by \"modern\" languages (e.g.: for example, hcreate() provides an API for a hashtable but is not reentrant, does not support a dynamic maximal number of elements and supports only key as string). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we consider a minimal set of libraries that are strictly required for high level programming. They either enhance what is provided by C11 and POSIX or they define a new missing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "C language supports low-level access to computer memory. This is often seen by experts as a strength. However it is also probably one of the main reasons why bugs, memory leak and security holes do exist. For allocation, functions ``malloc()``, ``calloc()`` and ``realloc()`` are used. Except ``calloc()``, those functions do not initialize the memory. This might look strange to users of Java, Python, or other similar languages that always initialize their memory. We believe this should be the default behaviour most of the time unless the profiling of the application shows otherwise. POSIX also provides ``free()``, for releasing the previously allocated memory. However this function does not nullify the pointer value given in argument. This often leads to a problem when the given pointer is given twice (by error) to ``free()``. Most of the time, keeping the previous value of the released memory is error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a program that illustrates all problems mentionned above with the POSIX API."

    "* In instruction (1), `errno` must be initialized before any call to function that modifies it. Unfortunately, the behavior of C standard functions is not consistent regarding their usage of `errno`. For example, most functions defined in `pthread.h` does not modify `errno`. Note that in this small example, the problem of setting `errno` might not appear at first, but in a real software, it is very easy to just forget its initialization. In such a case, the behavior of the processus might become completely strange: it might notify about error at some places where the error did not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instruction (2) is standard practice in C, and we will rely on that for error management: checking the return value of a function.\n",

    "* Instruction (3) uses the `strerror()` POSIX function defined in `string.h` which is not thread safe. It returns a string representing the error message related to the given error code, in our case `errno`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instruction (4) is a very simple way to deal with the error: we just display it. However, the message returned by `strerror()` does not hold all the context, in our case for example, the file name. The context also includes the whole call stack. Therefore, the message displayed is not very usefull. Of course, in this simple example, we just can display the file name in the `fprintf()` function, and it will solve the problem. However in the general case, the fact that `strerror()` does not include the context is a problem: you cannot return the value to the caller for example, you have to create a specific structure that includes the context along with the error message (or the code, but not `errno` since it might change afterwards). Error reporting is also very poor: either displays on standard error using one of `perror()` or `error()` or do it yourself with `fprintf()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instruction (5) is also dangerous: `strerror()` does not return an allocated string --- this is the main reason why it cannot include the context by the way --- therefore it must not be freed nor modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages uses [Exception Handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) to solve most of those issues: an exception is an object, therefore it can hold a context that helps understanding what the problem is all about. In some languages (e.g. Java), some exceptions cannot be ignored at all, they have to be dealt with by the caller or they must be passed up in the call stack. If C libraries for exception handling [exist](https://github.com/guillermocalvo/exceptions4c/wiki/alternatives) they are of course not standard. \n",

    "\n",

    "* efficient: determining if an error occurs after a call requires just a check between two pointers: the returned `bxierr_p` object and the constant `BXIERR_OK`; this operation is very fast (as fast as comparing two integers as done in the traditionnal approach);\n",
    "* rich: the returned `bxierr_p` object includes an error code, a message that can include part of the context --- such as the file name in our example --- and the complete call stack;\n",
    "* safer: since a `bxierr_p` object is returned, proper tool such as [Valgrind](valgrind.org) or [Coverity](www.coverity.com) will shout if it is not either destroyed or returned to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last property prevents errors from being ignored as it is usually done in C (how many times do you really check the code returned by printf()?). However, handling the error after each function call is clearly a pain and makes the code unreadable in the end. Note that one of the feature of exception handling is the ability to factorize the error handling code at one location in the `except/catch` block. The `bxierr.h` module provides various features in this regards:\n",

    "\n",
    "Loggers can be defined statically as in (1) or dynamically as in (8). The only difference is that static loggers are created at loading time (when the library is loaded in memory) whereas dynamic loggers are created the first time the `bxilog_registry_get()` function is called with a logger name unknown to the system. The set of loggers currently known by the system can be retrieved using `bxilog_registry_getall()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to initialize the bxilog library (7), a configuration must be created as in (4) and a logging handler should be added to it as in (6). Several handlers can be added sequentially. A logging handler consumes logs produced by threads and normally outputs them somewhere: on the console, on the filesystem, over the network, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `BXILOG_CONSOLE_HANDLER` displays logs with level 'LOWEST' up to 'NOTICE' on the process standard output file descriptor (stdout) but logs with level 'WARNING' up to 'PANIC' on the process standard error file descriptor (stderr). It also supports colorization of log according to their level. Other logging handler might behave differently.\n",

    "* `BXILOG_SYSLOG_HANDLER`: sends the logs to the syslog daemon;\n",
    "* `BXILOG_NETSNMP_HANDLER`: produces logs to the net-snmp logging library; \n",
    "* `BXILOG_REMOTE_HANDLER`: sends the logs to another process;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, two logs have been output but they have not been produced by our code. Those logs have a logging name starting with `~bxilog`: they are produced by the logging library itself. This is a perfect example of libraries written with the logging system: it might help in the debugging process. However, most of the time, those logs must not be seen. This is where filtering takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering occurs at two different places: first, each logger is given a logging level. Therefore, when a thread is requesting the production of a log at the TRACE level as in (2), if the logger is currently having level 'OUTPUT', the log won't be produced at all. Second, each log handler filters each received log according to the logger name used for the production of the log, and the level of that log.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering is expressed by a simple string, and processed with the `bxilog_filters_parse()` function as in (6). As an example, change (5) by commenting out the first line and uncommenting the second. The output will be rather different.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple yet very efficient mechanism to customize the logging system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `bxilog` Advanced  Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous section presented the main API of the `bxilog` module. However, the `bxilog` module provides many other advanced features presented in this section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Error Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that `bxierr` is a good error mechanism for high level programming. However, if no error reporting system is provided, it reduces significantly its purpose. Therefore `bxilog` supports error reporting as shown in (10). An error report is produced using the `BXILOG_REPORT` macro which destroys the error. This report includes many information such as the error code, the logging message and the backtrace. Note that the actual error message and the backtrace are not produced at the same logging level. This allows the console output to display a simple error message while the filesystem can contain a file with both the error message and the backtrace thanks to well defined filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bxilog` also provides `BXIASSERT()` as a replacement for the standard `assert()` function. The main advantage is that if you use `assert()`, pending logs might not be flushed by the various handlers and might get lost. Also, `BXIASSERT()` provides more information such as the backtrace. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, `BXIEXIT()` ensures all logs are flushed before actually exiting and provides more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fork Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the `bxilog` module is thread-safe (and lock-free), but it is also *fork-safe*. It basically,  means that it supports the standard POSIX `fork()` system call that creates a new process. In the face of a multi-threaded program which is always the case with the `bxilog` module, this is very hard to implement and usually unsupported. If you don't believe this statement, have a look to the RATIONALE section in the POSIX documentation of the [`fork()` system call](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fork.html) and also to the following articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/threads-and-fork-think-twice-before-using-them\n",
    "* http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/10/13/why-threads-cant-fork/\n",
    "\n",
    "When forking a child, the `bxilog` configuration remains the same in the parent, and the module is still configured as before the `fork()` call. However, in the child, this is not the case: the `bxilog` module has not been initialized. This is somewhat in opposition to the semantic of the `fork()` system call which is supposed to clone the entire process, and thus, to produce an exact equivalent of the parent. However, if you have seen the POSIX documentation, in the case of multi-threaded programs, this is no longer the case as only one thread is cloned: the one calling `fork()`. Anyway, the main reason is to prevent the overhead of a logging initialization with all the handlers if the only purpose of the `fork()` is the call to `execve()` which actually overwrite the whole process with a new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when using `bxilog`, after a `fork()`, keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the parent can continue to log as usual;\n",
    "* the child can do an `execve` as usual with no overhead, the `bxilog` has not been initialized;\n",
    "* the child might want to produce log itself, in this case, it can configure the `bxilog` as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that with such a mechanism, the child can either use the same configuration as its parent, or use a distinct configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example:"
