    "# High Level Programming in C\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the TIOBE report available at http://www.tiobe.com, Java and C are the two most popular languages for 15 years. Both share more than 30% of the ratings; other languages holds 6% or less of these ratings. While C is categorized a high level language, it remains mostly seen by average developers as a low level one with a high learning curve. One reason might be its excellent mapping with hardware which makes it a good candidate for operating system design. But we believe this is not the only reason, even not the main reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we present a set of requirements for high level programming that in our opinion are not fulfilled by the C language. For each requirement exposed, a solution is proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a project from scratch (in C) requires adopting coding style, coding convention, packaging rules among others that are shortly described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other languages, the C standard does not provide any coding convention *per se*. This leads to various coding convention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style. The [C FAQ](http://c-faq.com/style/layout.html) advises to follow the K&R coding style. We are even a bit stricter and we follow this guideline: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html. \n",
    "We also adopt the following convention:\n",
    "* most modules provides an object-oriented interface: for a given structure ``struct foo``, most module functions are defined by ``func(foo_p self, ...)`` where ``foo_p`` is a pointer on ``struct foo`` and represent the \"object\" on which the function ``func`` operates;\n",
    "* enumeration are suffixed by ``_e``;\n",
    "* static names defined in the .c file are prefixed with an underscore such as in ``_a_static_func(...)``;\n",
    "* internal API within a module implementation use double underscore to differenciate with external API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide two templates that ease structuring the code in a consistent manner:\n",
    "* header file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "* implementation file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Quality Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither C11, nor POSIX define code quality convention. There exist however at least two \"standards\" related somehow to this topic:\n",
    "* MISRA: initially for the automative industry but now enlargen to embedded system:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C;\n",
    "* CERT C Coding Standard: defines a set of rules and recommandation for security and safety: https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/HQE \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is the tooling required to ensure you conform to those standard. They might not be free of charge. At the very minimum, we recommand the following:\n",
    "* Compilation flags: turn all warning into error, all warnings must be treated before any release of the product; the sooner those warnings are taken into account, the easier the maintenance of the product on the long term.\n",
    "* Compile with various compilers ---  at the very least, gcc and clang: each compiler might raise some issues unseen by others;\n",
    "* Use [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) systematically to detect memory problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of a project is important, especially when the project is made of several subprojects. If each subproject holds the same layout, it becomes much easier to find out a given file. Therefore, we propose the following layout that should fit most projects requirements:\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versionning\n",
    "\n",
    "Versionning a product is not so easy. First, one must adopt the versionning convention. There are many ways for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning. We propose to follow a quite common convention:\n",
    "``major.minor.fix-release`` where:\n",
    "* ``major`` is incremented when incompatible changes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``minor`` is incremented when compatible changes have been introduced (new functions in the API for example);\n",
    "* ``fix`` is incremented when only bug fixes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``release`` is incremented when only packaging have been changed such as layout, makefile, or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the versionning scheme has been designed, providing this version at the code level must be done in order to  implement the ``cmd --version`` or the ``About...`` dialog box. This can be done using the following API:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages provide a system (integrated or not) to retrieve dependencies. For example, Java use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/), Python uses [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), Go has the [``go``](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) tool, ruby uses [``gem``](https://rubygems.org/) but C provides nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the guideline defined here, especially concerning [Packaging](#Packaging) and [Versionning](#Versionning), we propose a tool that might use dependency management of C packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: describe ``bxivcs``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the main difference between modern languages such as Java, Python, or Go, is the development cycle. Since Python is an interpreted language, it offers naturally the fastest one: code -> run. C, Java and Go must be compiled and their development cycle therefore includes one more step: code -> compile -> run. In particular, Java is so well integrated within \"modern\" IDEs such as Eclipse or Netbeans that the compile phase is mostly transparent. Therefore, at least in Java, the development cycle remains as fast as for any interpreted language: code -> run. Despite the support for the C language by Eclipse, it does not currently provide the same level of integration than with the Java language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages provides various mechanism that ease the debugging:\n",
    "* no direct access to memory;\n",
    "* smart boundary checking (that can be removed at runtime sometimes without harm);\n",
    "* stack trace on error with dynamic message, including file, function and line number;\n",
    "* assertion system that can be de-activated at runtime; \n",
    "* logging system that helps to understand what happens at runtime;\n",
    "* monitoring system (at least in Java, with JMX).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, C11 does not provide any way to produce a stack trace, nor a logging system, neither a monitoring system. POSIX does not provide anything comparable to what \"modern\" languages provide (more on that [later](#Standard Libraries)). Therefore, most of the time, in C, when a problem occurs, it can result in a segmentation fault at best (with the famous ``core dumped`` message), and undetected at worst (e.g.: memory corruption).\n",
    "\n",
    "One first solution for this problem is to guarantee code quality using several tools and techniques already presented in section [Code Quality Convention](#Code Quality Convention). But this is not sufficient to accelarate the development cycle: using ``gdb`` or ``valgrind`` for simple bugs is too costly/time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "POSIX ``assert.h`` module is also not sufficient: assertion can only be disabled at compile time, not at runtime, and the error message is quite minimal: the stacktrace is not included. Finally, of course, ``printf()`` is not a good option for a logging system: it is too costly, it does not provide enough information (thread, module, function, line), and cannot be partly disabled in a module and not in another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, some important libraries are missing for debugging as will be discussed in [Standard Libraries](#Standard Libraries). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard documentation of the C language is the venerable man page system. Despite being usefull for commands or configuration files, it does not compete with other API documentation system such as ``javadoc``, ``pydoc``, ``godoc`` and so on:\n",
    "* searching with the ``apropos`` command provides too many items, most of them are useless (e.g.: wrong section);\n",
    "* relation between structures/types/modules is not dynamic/hypertext;\n",
    "* no figure or schema can be provided since the system is text based;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, despite its age --- C has been invented in the early 70's by Dennis Richie --- it is very poor in general purpose standard libraries. For example, while the current C standard --- known as C11 --- has been specified in 2011 by http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf, it still does not provide generic list or hashtable comparable to what can be found in ”modern” languages such as Java, Python, Perl, Go, Haskell, among many others. In theory, one should distinguish the language --- the set of syntaxic and grammar rules that defines it --- from the default set of libraries provided with it. But in practice, both makes a whole that must fulfill an industrial project requirements. Most modern languages provide a very rich set of default libraries. A comparison between the documentation of the C11 default standard library https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Header_files  and at least one \"modern\" language makes this statement quite clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html,\n",
    "* Python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Perl: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Go: https://golang.org/pkg/#stdlib\n",
    "* Haskell: https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellpa2.html#x20-192000II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the POSIX standard defined in http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ provides many additionnal libraries to C11 --- general purpose hashtable and list can be found in the search.h header for example --- it is far from sufficient to be comparable to what is provided by \"modern\" languages (e.g.: for example, hcreate() provides an API for a hashtable but is not reentrant, does not support a dynamic maximal number of elements and supports only key as string). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we consider a minimal set of libraries that are strictly required for high level programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "C language supports low-level access to computer memory. This is often seen by experts as a strength. However it is also probably one of the main reasons for bugs, memory leak and security holes. For allocation, POSIX provides ``malloc()``, ``calloc()`` and ``realloc()``. Except ``calloc()``, those functions do not initialize the memory. This might look strange to user of Java, Python, or other similar languages that always initialize their memory. We believe this should be the default behaviour most of the time unless the profile application shows otherwise. POSIX also provides ``free()``, for releasing the previously allocated memory. However this function does not nullify the pointer value given in argument. This often leads to a problem when the given pointer is given twice (by error) to ``free()``. Most of the time, keeping the previous value of the released memory is error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a program that illustrates all problems mentionned above with the POSIX API."
