    "# High Level Programming in C\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the TIOBE report available at http://www.tiobe.com, Java and C are the two most popular languages for 15 years. Both share more than 30% of the ratings; other languages holds 6% or less of these ratings. While C is categorized a high level language, it remains mostly seen by average developers as a low level one with a high learning curve. One reason might be its excellent mapping with hardware which makes it a good candidate for operating system design. But we believe this is not the only reason, even not the main reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we present a set of requirements for high level programming that in our opinion are not fulfilled by the C language. For each requirement exposed, a solution is proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a project from scratch (in C) requires adopting coding style, coding convention, packaging rules among others that are shortly described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other languages, the C standard does not provide any coding convention *per se*. This leads to various coding convention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style. The [C FAQ](http://c-faq.com/style/layout.html) advises to follow the K&R coding style. We are even a bit stricter and we follow this guideline: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html. \n",
    "We also adopt the following convention:\n",
    "* most modules provides an object-oriented interface: for a given structure ``struct foo``, most module functions are defined by ``func(foo_p self, ...)`` where ``foo_p`` is a pointer on ``struct foo`` and represent the \"object\" on which the function ``func`` operates;\n",
    "* enumeration are suffixed by ``_e``;\n",
    "* static names defined in the .c file are prefixed with an underscore such as in ``_a_static_func(...)``;\n",
    "* internal API within a module implementation use double underscore to differenciate with external API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide two templates that ease structuring the code in a consistent manner:\n",
    "* header file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "* implementation file (TODO: provide the link)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Quality Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither C11, nor POSIX define code quality convention. There exist however at least two \"standards\" related somehow to this topic:\n",
    "* MISRA: initially for the automative industry but now enlargen to embedded system:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C;\n",
    "* CERT C Coding Standard: defines a set of rules and recommandation for security and safety: https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/HQE \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is the tooling required to ensure you conform to those standard. They might not be free of charge. At the very minimum, we recommand the following:\n",
    "* Compilation flags: turn all warning into error, all warnings must be treated before any release of the product; the sooner those warnings are taken into account, the easier the maintenance of the product on the long term.\n",
    "* Compile with various compilers ---  at the very least, gcc and clang: each compiler might raise some issues unseen by others;\n",
    "* Use [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) systematically to detect memory problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of a project is important, especially when the project is made of several subprojects. If each subproject holds the same layout, it becomes much easier to find out a given file. Therefore, we propose the following layout that should fit most projects requirements:\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versionning\n",
    "\n",
    "Versionning a product is not so easy. First, one must adopt the versionning convention. There are many ways for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning. We propose to follow a quite common convention:\n",
    "``major.minor.fix-release`` where:\n",
    "* ``major`` is incremented when incompatible changes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``minor`` is incremented when compatible changes have been introduced (new functions in the API for example);\n",
    "* ``fix`` is incremented when only bug fixes have been introduced;\n",
    "* ``release`` is incremented when only packaging have been changed such as layout, makefile, or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the versionning scheme has been designed, providing this version at the code level must be done in order to  implement the ``cmd --version`` or the ``About...`` dialog box. This can be done using the following API:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages provide a system (integrated or not) to retrieve dependencies. For example, Java use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/), Python uses [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), Go has the [``go``](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) tool, ruby uses [``gem``](https://rubygems.org/) but C provides nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the guideline defined here, especially concerning [Packaging](#Packaging) and [Versionning](#Versionning), we propose a tool that might use dependency management of C packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: describe ``bxivcs``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the main difference between modern languages such as Java, Python, or Go, is the development cycle. Since Python is an interpreted language, it offers naturally the fastest one: code -> run. C, Java and Go must be compiled and their development cycle therefore includes one more step: code -> compile -> run.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the comparison stops here: Java and Go are well defined   \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore, starting a project from scratch in C usually requires a significant amount of effort. The development cost associated to C project is also quite high compared to other modern languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle of development\n",
    "Coding, compiling, testing/debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No good unit testing framework (CUnit is a beginning)\n",
    "Compare to high level language: Code, test/debug\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Error leads to SEGFAULT, OR SIGBUS, ... hard to debug\n",
    "No logging system (syslog impact the whole system)\n",
    "\n",
    "Error leads to stacktrace with code line: ease debugging\n",
    "Logging system helps to understand what happened and can be deactivated at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is hard\n",
    "SEGFAULT, SIGBUS,... -> gdb required, valgrind too!\n",
    "Assert is not verbose enough\n",
    "printf is not good enough -> Too costly, Not flexible (All or nothing), Not enough information (What thread?, What module?, What function, line?), Mixed in multiprocess / multithread\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of modern API Documentation\n",
    "Compared to Python/Java and other languages\n",
    "Searching is hard (apropos?)\n",
    "Relation with other objects/structure/functions is weak\n",
    "Plain text\n",
    "No link (unless with some web site)\n",
    "Lack of real documentation engine. Doxygen is an imperfect candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, despite its age --- C has been invented in the early 70's by Dennis Richie --- it is very poor in general purpose standard libraries. For example, while the current C standard --- known as C11 --- has been specified in 2011 by http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf, it still does not provide generic list or hashtable comparable to what can be found in ”modern” languages such as Java, Python, Perl, Go, Haskell, among many others. In theory, one should distinguish the language --- the set of syntaxic and grammar rules that defines it --- from the default set of libraries provided with it. But in practice, both makes a whole that must fulfill an industrial project requirements. Most modern languages provide a very rich set of default libraries. A comparison between the documentation of the C11 default standard library https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Header_files  and at least one \"modern\" language makes this statement quite clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html,\n",
    "* Python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Perl: https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html,\n",
    "* Go: https://golang.org/pkg/#stdlib\n",
    "* Haskell: https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellpa2.html#x20-192000II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the POSIX standard defined in http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ provides many additionnal libraries to C11 --- general purpose hashtable and list can be found in the search.h header for example --- it is far from sufficient to be comparable to what is provided by \"modern\" languages (e.g.: for example, hcreate() provides an API for a hashtable but is not reentrant, does not support a dynamic maximal number of elements and supports only key as string). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we consider a minimal set of libraries that are strictly required for high level programming.\n",

    "* Atomic write -> no mixup between different processes on same file\n",
    "* Support unlimited number of loggers\n",
    "* Support simple but powerful filtering mechanism\n",
