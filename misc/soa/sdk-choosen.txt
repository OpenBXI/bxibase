C lacks a standard SDK that provides useful libraries for standard stuff such as:

- logging
- config file parsing
- I/O operations (fopen() sucks, open() is not portable and too low level)
- data structures (list, hash map, and so on)
- among others.


GLib provides such an SDK, however the following are cons:

- any glib application requires at least two threads since glib starts
its own thread internally

- it does not provide lock-free data structures (actually data
structure are not thread safe). 

 - by the way, GLib uses wrapper on top of most standard C type which
makes it cumbersome to use at the first place.


123/1424 packets uses the GLIB.

Apache Runtime Runtime (APR) provides similar SDK.  But the
documentation is just very thin, consisting of a doxygen web site with
no tutorial, and good stuff. It does not seem to be used that much by
the way: 2/1424 packets use it on my desktop.

I finally found that article which just shows how cumbersome it is to
find a good SDK in C:
