Optimization of bxilog:

	- Use direct PUB/SUB from BC threads + 2 threads, one for console, one for file, and potentially other threads for syslog or whatever
	- Gives hints to GCC, see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
          for details
	- Use Profiler
	- See logstash
