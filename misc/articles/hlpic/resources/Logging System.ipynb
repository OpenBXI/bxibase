    "## Logging System\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is useful for different kind of people:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Core developpers: *while* developping his software, a programmer places logging instructions at some places in order to understand what is happening;\n",
    "* Functionnal test writers: when writing a test, a tester tries to understand the logs produced by the software;\n",
    "* End-users: messages are sometimes targetted to an end-user;\n",
    "* Maintenance engieneers: the whole set of messages produced by the software is often used by a maintenance engineer to understand a problem in a software and to repair it when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this list, it must be clear that logs are written from day-0 of a software, and might be used in production or even in post-mortem diagnostic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern languages provide a powerful logging API that ease high level programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java has its own [java.logging API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html), and also some alternatives such as [`log4j`](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), or [`logback`](http://logback.qos.ch/);\n",
    "* Python includes the [logging](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) module;\n",
    "* Go provides the [log](https://golang.org/pkg/log/) package.\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "However C provides nothing. POSIX provides `syslog()` but as its name implies it has been designed for the system: messages sent by a sofware, are received by the system loggers that decides what to do with the message at a system level. Therefore, even if the end-user can change the logging level of its software, it cannot change anything else: in particular, it usually has not the permission to read the file where the logs are written to (e.g.: `/var/log/message`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve high level programming, the logging system must be used for any message oriented output whether being on screen, on a file, or over the network. This has several advantages compared to the use of a logging API in addition to the standard `printf()` for console output:\n",
    "\n",
    "* development simplification (one API to learn only, but you are right, any C programmer knows `printf()`);\n",
    "* performance optimization: a single call might produce many outputs instead of one call with the logging API and one call for the console output with `printf()`;\n",
    "* customizability: the software uses the logging API to produce messages, but how and where those messages are produced \n",
    "  is defined by the configuration.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, with a correct configuration one can guarantee that all messages produced on the console (and seen by the end users) are also recorded to a file (that can be hidden if required). The file might contain much more information (according to the configured verbosity), but always contain the messages that have been seen by the end-user. This can be quite usefull for debugging and/or maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we propose the `bxilog.h` module.  "

    "#### Loggers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce a log, a thread needs a logger. A logger is basically defined by an arbitrary name. The convention is to create a pseudo tree hierarchy using the '.' as a character separator for different loggers. This is important for filtering. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loggers can be defined statically as in (1) or dynamically as in (8). The only difference is that static loggers are created at loading time (when the library is loaded in memory) whereas dynamic loggers are created the first time the `bxilog_registry_get()` function is called with a logger name unknown to the system. The set of loggers currently known by the system can be retrieved using `bxilog_registry_getall()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a logger, producing a log can be done using various macros which name represents the logging level as shown in (2) with the level `TRACE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The bxilog module defines several logging levels that is a superset of syslog ones. Retrieving the set of logging levels can be done using the `bxilog_get_all_level_names()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OUTPUT` level should be used as a replacement for `printf()` as shown in (3). Notice also that levels from `NOTICE` up to `PANIC` should also be used as a replacement for `fprintf(stderr)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "How and where those logs will be produced is given by the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration of log handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to initialize the bxilog library (7), a configuration must be created as in (4) and a logging handler should be added to it as in (6). Several handlers can be added sequentially. A logging handler consumes logs produced by threads and normally outputs them somewhere: on the console, on the filesystem, over the network, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `BXILOG_CONSOLE_HANDLER` displays logs with level 'LOWEST' up to 'NOTICE' on the process standard output file descriptor (stdout) but logs with level 'WARNING' up to 'PANIC' on the process standard error file descriptor (stderr). It also supports colorization of log according to their level. Other logging handler might behave differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple API is provided to implement new logging handlers. Currently, bxilog provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BXILOG_CONSOLE_HANDLER`: produces logs on either stdout or stderr according to a customizable log    \n",
    "  level with or without customizable colors;\n",
    "* `BXILOG_FILE_HANDLER`: produces logs in a file with all details;\n",
    "* `BXILOG_SYSLOG_HANDLER`: sends the logs to the syslog daemon;\n",
    "* `BXILOG_NETSNMP_HANDLER`: produces logs to the net-snmp logging library; \n",
    "* `BXILOG_REMOTE_HANDLER`: sends the logs to another process;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, two logs have been output but they have not been produced by our code. Those logs have a logging name starting with `~bxilog`: they are produced by the logging library itself. This is a perfect example of libraries written with the logging system: it might help in the debugging process. However, most of the time, those logs must not be seen. This is where filtering takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering occurs at two different places: first, each logger is given a logging level. Therefore, when a thread is requesting the production of a log at the TRACE level as in (2), if the logger is currently having level 'OUTPUT', the log won't be produced at all. Second, each log handler filters each received log according to the logger name used for the production of the log, and the level of that log.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering is expressed by a simple string, and processed with the `bxilog_filters_parse()` function as in (6). As an example, change (5) by commenting out the first line and uncommenting the second. The output will be rather different.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple yet very efficient mechanism to customize the logging system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced  Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous section presented the main API of the `bxilog` module. However, the `bxilog` module provides many other advanced features presented in this section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that `bxierr` is a good error mechanism for high level programming. However, if no error reporting system is provided, it reduces significantly its purpose. Therefore `bxilog` supports error reporting as shown in (10). An error report is produced using the `BXILOG_REPORT` macro which destroys the error. This report includes many information such as the error code, the logging message and the backtrace. Note that the actual error message and the backtrace are not produced at the same logging level. This allows the console output to display a simple error message while the filesystem can contain a file with both the error message and the backtrace thanks to well defined filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bxilog` also provides `BXIASSERT()` as a replacement for the standard `assert()` function. The main advantage is that if you use `assert()`, pending logs might not be flushed by the various handlers and might get lost. Also, `BXIASSERT()` provides more information such as the backtrace. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, `BXIEXIT()` ensures all logs are flushed before actually exiting and provides more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fork Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the `bxilog` module is thread-safe (and lock-free), but it is also *fork-safe*. It basically,  means that it supports the standard POSIX `fork()` system call that creates a new process. In the face of a multi-threaded program which is always the case with the `bxilog` module, this is very hard to implement and usually unsupported. If you don't believe this statement, have a look to the RATIONALE section in the POSIX documentation of the [`fork()` system call](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fork.html) and also to the following articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/threads-and-fork-think-twice-before-using-them\n",
    "* http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/10/13/why-threads-cant-fork/\n",
    "\n",
    "When forking a child, the `bxilog` configuration remains the same in the parent, and the module is still configured as before the `fork()` call. However, in the child, this is not the case: the `bxilog` module has not been initialized. This is somewhat in opposition to the semantic of the `fork()` system call which is supposed to clone the entire process, and thus, to produce an exact equivalent of the parent. However, if you have seen the POSIX documentation, in the case of multi-threaded programs, this is no longer the case as only one thread is cloned: the one calling `fork()`. Anyway, the main reason is to prevent the overhead of a logging initialization with all the handlers if the only purpose of the `fork()` is the call to `execve()` which actually overwrite the whole process with a new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when using `bxilog`, after a `fork()`, keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the parent can continue to log as usual;\n",
    "* the child can do an `execve` as usual with no overhead, the `bxilog` has not been initialized;\n",
    "* the child might want to produce log itself, in this case, it can configure the `bxilog` as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that with such a mechanism, the child can either use the same configuration as its parent, or use a distinct configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example:"

In this last case, any thread that is not blocking the signal can be interrupted (in the middle of any function...) in order to process the signal. By default, the behavior is to just terminate the whole process. The end result, is often a useless message as shown by the example below:"

Actually, this has nothing to do with the `bxilog` module: replace the `OUT()` instruction by a `printf`, the result will be the same.
