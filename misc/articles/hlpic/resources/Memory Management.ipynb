    "# Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "C language supports low-level access to computer memory. This is often seen by experts as a strength. However it is also probably one of the main reasons why bugs, memory leaks and security holes do exist. For allocation, functions ``malloc()``, ``calloc()`` and ``realloc()`` are used. Except ``calloc()``, those functions do not initialize the memory. This might look strange to users of Java, Python, or other similar languages that always initialize their memory. We believe this should be the default behaviour most of the time unless the profiling of the application shows otherwise. POSIX also provides ``free()``, for releasing the previously allocated memory. However this function does not nullify the pointer value given in argument. This often leads to a problem when the given pointer is given twice (by error) to ``free()``. Most of the time, keeping the previous value of the released memory is error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a program that illustrates all problems mentionned above with the POSIX API."
